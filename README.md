# AI-Powered-Math-Chatbot

This project implements an AI-powered chatbot integrated within Google Colab. It's designed to assist users with a range of tasks, primarily focusing on:

1. **Solving Mathematical Problems:** The chatbot can solve equations (including polynomial and quadratic equations), calculate derivatives, and perform integration.

2. **Basic Conversation:** It has some pre-defined responses to handle greetings and general knowledge questions, making the interaction more engaging.

3. **Error Handling:** The chatbot includes error handling mechanisms to gracefully manage invalid mathematical inputs and provide informative error messages.
